# Development-of-a-Depth-of-Anesthesia-DoA-Index-Using-Supervised-Machine-Learning
# Abstract
Depth of anesthesia is one of the important parameters that vary depending on the type of surgery to ascertain patient safety and optimization of drugs administration. This project intends to formulate a new Depth of Anesthesia index (DOA index), utilizing machine learning techniques to uplift the accuracy and predictability compared to the currently used indices. This project is specifically focused on Random Forest and Linear Regression methods for the feature selection and model building purposes. The formulated indices are evaluated by metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and Pearson correlation. The results achieved from this project suggest that the formulated models for the two new indices show a strong predictability with significantly correlated predicted and actual values. But the study conducted using the evaluation metrics ( MSE, R-squared, and Pearson correlation) indicates that index developed using Random Forest shows more accuracy and consistency compared to the index based on Linear Regression
